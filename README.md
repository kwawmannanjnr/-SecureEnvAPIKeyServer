**SecureEnvAPIKeyServer**

SecureEnvAPIKeyServer is a Node.js server designed with security in mind, ensuring that sensitive information like API keys remains secure and is not exposed through public endpoints. This server is an example of best practices for handling environment variables and securing API endpoints.

**Features**
Environment Variable Management: Demonstrates how to securely manage API keys using environment variables.

Local Endpoint Example: Provides an example of a Local API endpoint that requires authentication.

**Getting Started**
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

**Prerequisites**

Node.js installed on your local machine.
Basic knowledge of Node.js and Express.

**Installing**
First, clone the repository to your local machine:

**bash**

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/SecureEnvAPIKeyServer.git
cd SecureEnvAPIKeyServer
Then, install the necessary dependencies:

**bash**

npm install

**Configuration**
To run the server, you need to set up an environment variable for the API key. You can do this in two ways:

Using the command line:

bash

MY_API_KEY=your_api_key_here node server.js
Setting an environment variable on your system:

On Linux/macOS:
bash

export MY_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
On Windows Command Prompt:
cmd

set MY_API_KEY=your_api_key_here

On Windows PowerShell:

powershell

$env:MY_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
Then, run the server with node server.js.

**Running the Server**
To start the server, run:

bash

node server.js
The server will start, and you can access it at http://localhost:3001.

**Usage**
To access the public endpoint: http://localhost:3001/api.
To access the secure endpoint, use a tool like Postman or Curl with basic auth headers.
